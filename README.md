These are not the first solutions I came up with, nor are they the ones that I would put into production code.  They are interesting, however, either for using bitwise operators like Puzzle 2 or for the surprising brevity like Puzzle 5.  

Some of these are my own solutions, some I found online, and others I found online and then improved.
